    "Finally, to conclude this project, we have got a small glimpse fo how real-life Data science project looks like. I have used some frequently used python libraries to handle JSON file, plotting graphs, and other exploratory data analysis. Use Foursquare API to major boroughs of New York City and their neighborhoods. Potential for this kind of analysis in a real-life business problem is discussed in great detail. Also, some of the drawbacks and chances for improvements to represent even more realistic pictures are mentioned. As a final note, all of the above analyses is depended on the adequacy and accuracy of Four Square data. A more comprehensive analysis and future work would need to incorporate data from other external databases.\n"
